## Project Title: Iris Flower Classification using Decision Tree

**Description:**
Classifying iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Uses petal and sepal measurements for classification.

**Dataset:**
Contains sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Google Colab.

**How to Run:**
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Run the cells to train and test the model.

**Key Steps:**
Data Preprocessing
Decision Tree Model Training
Model Evaluation & Accuracy Check

**Results:**
Model accuracy and confusion matrix.

**Future Improvements:**
Trying different ML models like Random Forest or SVM.
Deploying the model using a web application.
